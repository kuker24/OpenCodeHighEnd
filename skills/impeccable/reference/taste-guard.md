# Taste Quality Guard

Canonical lightweight quality guard for UI implementation and review.
Adapted from [taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill) (MIT, Leonxlnx) and [anti-slop](https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop) (MIT, Miqdad Badjuber) to integrate with OpenCodeHighEnd craft standards.

Load this once before UI editing and verify against it during final review. This reference is not a separate specialist; it operates within the phase owner (`impeccable`, `scroll-craft`, `emil-design-eng`).

## Precedence & Conflict Resolution

When guidelines diverge, resolve in strict order:
1. **User Scope & Request**: Explicit brief, pinned aesthetic, brand guidelines, and user constraints always win.
2. **Product Truth & Accessibility**: Real facts, working functionality, keyboard navigation, WCAG AA contrast (≥4.5:1 body, ≥3:1 large), and measured performance outrank aesthetic taste.
3. **Project System & Stack**: Inherit existing tokens, theme, components, and package manager. Never force Tailwind v4, React/Next.js, Motion, or new fonts onto projects that do not use them.
4. **OCBF Architecture Contracts**: Phase ownership, thin routing, isolated tests.
5. **Taste Heuristics**: Guidelines below refine execution; they never overrule layers 1–4.

*Anti-Dogma Rule*: Taste guidelines discourage unexamined category defaults, but they are NOT absolute bans. Purple accents, Inter font, SVG icons, symmetrical grids, eyebrows, or cards are fully permitted when the brand, project, or user requests them.

## Filter Discipline (Filter ≠ Style Guide)

This guard is a **filter, not a style guide**. It prescribes no specific colors, fonts, or layouts. It rejects unmotivated category defaults and fake content; visual direction, beauty, and brand voice come from your `DESIGN.md` or a shortlist from the Design Bank.
- **BANK_MISS ≠ generate**: When an atomic component (button, input, card, nav) misses the bank, do not invent arbitrary hex or radius; fall back to project shadcn components or ask.
- **Stitch / UI Skills Boundary**: Stitch MCP is for comps/screens only; UI Skills is for design-skill lookup only. Neither implements production UI alone.
- **DESIGN.md Conflict**: If an explicit pin or `DESIGN.md` asks for a named slop pattern, name the element and the conflict, then ask keep-or-drop. Never silently follow and never silently override. Palette and typography that constitute brand identity are never slop.

## The Four Taste Gates (Checklist)

Before shipping UI, verify against the four gates:

1. **Hard Gate (Absolute)**:
   - Zero hallucinated precision (no fake stats like `99.4%`, fake logos, or fake review quotes).
   - Zero synthetic social proof or fake testimonial carousels.
   - No decorative status dots (glowing/pulsing dots must mark real operational state).
   - No two-state layouts (phone stack + desktop grid with nothing between is slop; define mid breakpoints or unified canvas).
   - No unexamined category defaults (purple gradient hero, cyan mesh, Inter-on-white cards) unless requested.

2. **Purpose-Gate (Technique Allowed, Reason Required)**:
   - Every visual effect, parallax, or animation must serve an explicit purpose (hierarchy, state transition, narrative pacing). If unjustified in one sentence, cut it.
   - At most one marquee per page, and only when content genuinely benefits from continuous streaming.
   - No unmotivated glassmorphism or glowing borders.

3. **Quality Locks (Consistency & Soundness)**:
   - Surface mode respected: **Persuade** (marketing/landing), **Operate** (dashboard/admin/tools), **Read** (docs/articles), or **Experience** (showcase/portfolio). Operate demands scanability, high utility, and native conventions.
   - Single palette role lock: neutral base + primary accent.
   - Token & corner radius consistency across inputs, cards, and buttons.
   - Complete interactive states (default, hover, focus-visible, active feedback, disabled, loading, empty, error).
   - WCAG AA contrast (≥4.5:1 body, ≥3:1 large) and visible `:focus-visible` rings.
   - `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses ambient/scroll motion to static presentation.

4. **Delivery Gate (Pre-Ship Audit)**:
   - Review desktop and mobile renders together under observed browser inspection.
   - Confirm layout stability (e.g. `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent viewport jumping).
   - Verify all packages exist in `package.json` before importing; no unrequested heavy dependencies.

## The 11 Core Quality Guardrails

### 1. Intent & Surface Mode
- Classify the surface purpose: **Persuade** (marketing/landing), **Operate** (dashboard/admin/tools), **Read** (docs/articles), or **Experience** (showcase/portfolio).
- Match density and expression to mode: Operate demands scanability, high utility, and native conventions; Persuade allows bolder visual commitment.

### 2. Information Hierarchy & Typography
- Obvious visual scale: one dominant focal point per viewport, clear heading-to-body rhythm.
- Display type: default tight tracking, balanced lines; descender clearance on italic display fonts (`pb-1` / minimum `leading-[1.1]`).
- Body text: comfortable measure (65–75ch), readable line-height, distinct secondary text hierarchy.

### 3. Spacing & Visual Rhythm
- Consistent padding and gap scale across the page; more whitespace above a section heading than below it.
- Never let heroes float arbitrarily far down the viewport (cap hero top padding at ~6rem / `pt-24`).
- Desktop navigation on a single line (max height 80px).

### 4. Components, Tokens, & Navigation
- Single palette lock: choose neutral base + one primary accent role; maintain accent consistency throughout the page.
- Corner radius consistency: uniform scale across cards, inputs, and buttons unless a distinct token hierarchy is documented.
- Inherit existing design system tokens and component libraries where present.
- **Anti-Slop Visual Fences**: Reject unexamined category templates: no default dark purple-gradient hero, glowing cyan/purple mesh backgrounds, or ungrounded Inter-on-white-card layouts unless explicitly requested.

### 5. Product Truth & Factual Content
- **Zero Hallucinated Precision**: Never invent precise statistics (`94.2%`, `4.8x`), fake customer logos, fake review quotes, or fake partner endorsements.
- **Anti-Slop Copy & Proof Fences**: Never generate artificial testimonials, fake review carousels, or empty AI kickoff clichés ("Let's dive in", "Supercharge your workflow").
- If demonstration data is needed in greenfield work, label it clearly as synthetic demonstration data.
- Refinement preserves existing copy and claims; redesign replaces presentation while preserving factual truths.

### 6. Complete Interactive States
- Implement the full lifecycle: default, `:hover`, `:focus-visible`, `:active` (subtle tactile feedback), disabled, loading, empty, and inline error states.
- CTA clarity: button labels fit on a single line at desktop; avoid duplicate CTA intents with competing labels on the same page.

### 7. Responsiveness & Breakpoint Defense
- Explicit mobile collapse (`< 768px`) for every multi-column layout or bento grid; verify no horizontal overflow.
- **Two-State Layout**: A phone stack plus desktop grid with nothing defined between is slop. Need at least one mid breakpoint or an explicit single-canvas choice.
- Viewport stability: use `min-h-[100dvh]` rather than `h-screen` to prevent iOS address-bar layout jumping.
- Test with real copy at actual target viewports, not placeholder words that never wrap.

### 8. Accessibility & Reduced Motion
- Every interactive element has a visible, high-contrast `:focus-visible` ring.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: all ambient motion, parallax, and scroll-triggers must collapse to clean static presentation.
- Dark and light modes: maintain legible hierarchy and WCAG AA contrast across both color schemes.

### 9. Motivated Visual Effects
- Every animation must have a clear purpose: hierarchy, feedback, narrative pacing, or state change. If an effect cannot be justified in one sentence, omit it.
- **Decorative Status Dot**: A glowing or pulsing dot must mark a real state (online, error, recording). If it marks nothing, remove it.
- Avoid unmotivated glassmorphism, glowing borders, or arbitrary parallax loops.
- Horizontal marquees: at most one per page where content genuinely benefits from continuous stream.

### 10. Dependency & Stack Discipline
- Verify packages in `package.json` before importing. Never assume a 3rd-party library is present.
- Do not introduce heavy dependencies (GSAP, Three.js, heavy icon sets) for simple CSS or native capabilities.

### 11. Observed Render Verification
- Judge visual quality solely on actual rendered output (inspected browser session or captured screenshot), never on stylesheet intention or mental model.
- Inspect desktop and mobile together before signing off.
