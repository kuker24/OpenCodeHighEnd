# Playwright QA Skill Notice

This skill is an OpenCodeHighEnd adaptation of the Playwright CLI interface
originally developed by Microsoft Corporation.

## Modifications for OpenCodeHighEnd
- Adapted as an in-session exploratory QA tool for local UI changes.
- Scoped browser sessions with task/workspace naming to prevent cross-project collisions.
- Explicit runtime discovery without unprompted background downloads or package mutations.
- Strict separation between OCBF tool invocation and target application dependencies.
- Suite preservation: project Playwright Test and other E2E suites remain authoritative for regressions.
