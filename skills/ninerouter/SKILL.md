description: Route model inference, image generation, TTS, STT, embeddings, or web fetch/search through a local or remote 9Router gateway. Use when user mentions 9router, NINEROUTER_URL, gateway models, or multi-provider fallbacks. Not a core MCP server or credential store; degrades gracefully to NOT_CONFIGURED when gateway is absent.

# ninerouter

First-party gateway stub connecting to a user-managed **9Router** instance for multi-provider LLM routing, image/video generation, text-to-speech, transcription, embeddings, and web tools.

Intent: `gateway_llm`. 9Router is a `FOREIGN_ON_DEMAND` gateway, not an extra core MCP server. Core MCP remains strictly `codebase-memory-mcp`, `context7`, and `shadcn`.

## Configuration & Environment

9Router is configured strictly via environment variables:

- `NINEROUTER_URL`: Gateway base URL (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:20128`).
- `NINEROUTER_KEY`: Gateway API key (required only if `requireApiKey` is enabled). Passed as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Never log or hardcode key values.

### Fail-Closed Security Rules

- **Zero-Bind Prohibition**: If `NINEROUTER_URL` contains `0.0.0.0` or binds all interfaces, fail closed immediately.
- **Graceful Absence**: If `NINEROUTER_URL` is unreachable or unconfigured, report `NOT_CONFIGURED`. This is an optional gateway, never an installer or `opencode-he doctor` failure.

## Health & Discovery

Verify connectivity:
```bash
curl -s "$NINEROUTER_URL/api/health"
# Expected response: {"ok":true}
```

Available model endpoints:
- Chat / LLM: `/v1/models`
- Image generation: `/v1/models/image`
- Text-to-speech: `/tts`
- Speech-to-text: `/stt`
- Embeddings: `/embedding`
- Web search / fetch: `/web`
