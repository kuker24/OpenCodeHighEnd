## Modifications for OpenCodeHighEnd
- Adapted as an opt-in model-invoked skill for TypeScript/JavaScript projects.
- Added `scripts/manage.mjs` supporting 4 explicit modes:
  - `audit`: isolated discovery reporting findings per rule and file category without repo mutations.
  - `recommended`: curated high-signal OCBF profile (`no-chained-type-assertions`, `no-widen-then-assert`, audit on `no-known-value-widening`, audit/warn on `require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion`).
  - `strict`: full 15-rule generic ruleset from upstream snapshot.
  - `custom`: project-configured rules.
  - `effect`: opt-in Effect service layer rules for direct Effect dependencies.
- Added safe removal, update, idempotency checks, and collision detection.
- Strictly segregated from core OCBF Python dependencies (no Oxlint forced onto OCBF itself).

## Additional Attribution
UI and copy named patterns in `rules/03-prose-discipline.md`, `skills/impeccable/reference/taste-guard.md`, and `skills/writing-for-agents/SKILL.md` also draw on [miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop](https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop) MIT (v3.2.x patterns; no verbatim dump, zero extra catalog skills or external runtime dependencies added).
