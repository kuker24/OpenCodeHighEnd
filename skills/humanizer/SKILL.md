# Humanizer

Remove artificial patterns, synthetic cadence, and formulaic tells from user-facing prose. Precision beats style. This is an editorial pass for writing intended for human readers.

## Boundaries

- **Never** auto-humanize ordinary coding output, diffs, PR summaries, or CLI tool output.
- **Never** rewrite source code, tests, CLI commands, YAML frontmatter, citations, or locked SmartDoc content.
- **Never** invent facts, quotes, statistics, or sources to make text feel more colorful.
- **Refuse UI implementation**: this skill polishes copy and prose; UI styling, atoms, and layouts route to `impeccable`.
- **Refuse linter installation**: this skill does not configure Oxlint or static code linters; TypeScript/JavaScript lint rules route strictly to `/install-anti-slop`.
- Voice sample provided by the user overrides default pattern recommendations.
- Academic manuscripts after GOAL_LOCK route to `academic` first; humanizer is an optional final prose polish only when requested.
- Technical documentation structure (Diátaxis / STE) routes to `/technical-writing`.

## Semantic-Preservation Constitution

These tokens must survive byte-equivalent unless the user explicitly requested changes:

- Facts, numbers, dates, personal names, proper nouns
- URLs, citations, file paths, line references
- Code snippets, CLI commands, flags, API endpoints, error strings
- Direct quotes
- Negations (`not`, `never`, `unless`, `without`)
- Security, compliance, and legal wording
- Legitimate domain terms when they represent the actual technical concept (`interface`, `vector`, `primitive`, `surface`, `modality`, `schema`)

Replace an abstract term only when it is empty marketing jargon (e.g. marketing "vector" → "pathway"; linear algebra `vector` stays untouched).

## The Five Pattern Families

Audit text against the five families of AI writing tells (detailed catalog in [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md)):

1. **Staging:** Theatrical setups, announcements, throat-clearing, and artificial transitions ("In today's fast-paced world", "Let's delve into", "It is important to remember"). Cut the preamble; start with the substance.
2. **Rhythm:** Monotone sentence lengths and predictable cadence. AI drafts often output uniform 15-20 word sentences. Vary sentence length dynamically: combine punchy fragments with nuanced multi-clause observations.
3. **Inflation:** Hyperbolic puffery, superlatives, and buzzword padding ("pivotal", "testament to", "game-changing", "seamlessly", "foster", "garner", "tapestry"). Use grounded, factual vocabulary.
4. **Formatting:** Obsessive bullet lists where prose fits better, excessive bolding on lead-in words, and overused em dashes (—). Convert mechanical lists to flowing paragraphs; replace em dashes with commas or separate sentences.
5. **Leftovers:** Chatbot residue and formulaic conclusions ("Certainly!", "I hope this helps!", "In conclusion, the future looks bright"). Remove conversational fluff and generic wrap-ups.

## Usage Modes: During vs After

- **During Generation (Proactive Guidance)**:
  - Lead with the substance immediately; cut kickoff throat-clearing ("Let's dive in", "In today's fast-paced world").
  - Reject invented numbers, fabricated benchmarks, and synthetic testimonials.
  - Ban sparkle fluff, emoji bullet clutter, and beta-pill hype in headlines and action buttons.
  - Keep claims verifiable and grounded in product truth.
- **After Audit (Retrospective Polish)**:
  - Scan existing prose against the five pattern families.
  - Report a brief numbered findings list of AI tells, present the tightened rewrite, and verify with the user before committing destructive edits.

## Workflow

### 1. Ingestion Mode
- **Paste Mode:** User provided an excerpt directly. Edit and output the rewritten prose with an optional summary of removed patterns.
- **File Mode:** Target file specified. Read the target, inspect surrounding context, edit user-facing text, and preserve Markdown formatting and code blocks unchanged.

### 2. Analysis Pass
- Scan for the five pattern families.
- Identify the author's intended tone (casual, authoritative, editorial, journalistic).
- Note any user voice sample provided to calibrate rhythm and vocabulary.

### 3. Rewrite & Refine
- Strip throat-clearing and puffery.
- Break monotonous sentences and vary paragraph lengths.
- Replace AI vocabulary with direct, everyday verbs and nouns.
- Keep domain terminology intact.

### 4. Integrity Check
- Audit against the Semantic-Preservation Constitution: ensure no dates, numbers, URLs, or technical terms were altered or dropped.
- Self-audit: "Does any sentence still sound generated by a committee or an LLM?" If yes, tighten further.
