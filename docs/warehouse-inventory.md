# OpenCodeHighEnd — Skill Warehouse Inventory

This inventory establishes the contract for warehouse skills across the five analyzed upstream repositories:
1. `blader/humanizer` (MIT)
2. `cathrynlavery/diagram-design` (MIT)
3. `heygen-com/hyperframes` (Apache-2.0)
4. `Imbad0202/academic-research-skills` (CC-BY-NC-4.0)
5. `affaan-m/ECC` (MIT)

## Contract Rules
- Decisions: `NEW | MERGE | REJECT | DEFER | DONE`
- Batch `2a`: Rows marked `decision=NEW` with `batch=2a` were ported in Wave 2.
- Batch `3a`: Only remaining `DEFER` rows marked `decision=NEW` with `batch=3a` are ported in Wave 3. Do not reopen `REJECT`. Do not re-port `DONE`/`MERGE`.
- External harness runtimes, auto-mutations, and CC-BY-NC text are strictly REJECTED.
- `DEFER` does not promote to `NEW` without an existence pass and a no-skill baseline. Route the existence pass through `skill-stocktake` and the baseline through the `eval-harness` utility gate. A procedure that a current model already performs unprompted stays `DEFER` or becomes `REJECT`.
- Capability drift is a legitimate reason to `COMPRESS` or `RETIRE` an existing specialist. It is never a reason to add a twin skill beside it.

## Summary Counts

| Decision | Count | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `NEW` | 10 | Uniquely missing capabilities ported to first-party MIT BestFriend specialists (Batch 2a + 3a) |
| `DONE` | 3 | Specialists already ported to OpenCodeHighEnd (`humanizer`, `diagram-design`, `hyperframes`) |
| `MERGE` | 83 | Capabilities merged into existing BestFriend specialists or references (zero text plagiarism) |
| `REJECT` | 158 | Foreign harness runtimes, framework sprawl, trading bots, vendor ops, and incompatible licenses |
| `DEFER` | 64 | Domain-specific procedures cataloged for future warehouse wave evaluation |
| **TOTAL** | **318** | Total upstream skill items cataloged |

## Wave AI LABS 8 Evaluation

Evaluation and disposition contract for the AI LABS 8-repo wave (procedural 3D, perception, hooks, UI registries, harness runtimes, mobile platforms, eval benchmarks, anti-slop):

| Candidate / Repo | Decision | BestFriend Target | Reason |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `img2threejs` | **NEW** | `skills/img2threejs` | Procedural Three.js TypeScript Group reconstruction from reference object image; quality-gated, no downloaded mesh blobs. |
| `reticle` | **FOREIGN_ON_DEMAND** | `mcp.reticle` | Optional visual perception MCP (`npx -y @reticlehq/server mcp`). Server licensed under FSL-1.1-ALv2; not vendored. Perception only, never auto-implementer. |
| `chisel` (hooks) | **REJECT** | `-` | Session/prompt/tool hooks coupled to Claude Code runtime. Context Guard remains NOT_PORTED. |
| `ui-skills` | **FOREIGN_ON_DEMAND** | `mcp.ui-skills` | Optional remote MCP (`https://www.ui-skills.com/mcp`) for design-skill lookup only. Product UI remains Design Bank + Impeccable + Design V2 + shadcn. |
| `ouroboros` / Q00 | **REJECT** | `-` | Autonomous evolution harness / continuous-learning runtime rejected. Interview primitives already live in `grill-with-docs` / `to-spec`. |
| `swiftui-skills` | **DEFER** | `-` | Apple platform / Xcode 26 ecosystem deferred. Target platform gate remains Linux x86_64 and OpenCode 2.x. |
| `caliper` | **FOREIGN_ON_DEMAND** | `-` | Benchmark CLI runner (`caliper-eval`). Maintainer may run off-tree via pipx; zero `lib/` vendor coupling. |
| `anti-slop` | **MERGE** | `install-anti-slop`, `impeccable`, `rules/03-prose-discipline.md` | Anti-pattern guardrails merged into existing taste, prose, and linting references; zero extra catalog skills. |

## Wave MarkItDown

Microsoft MarkItDown as an ingest converter, not a second document OS. SmartDoc keeps contract/QA/render.

| Candidate / Repo | Decision | BestFriend Target | Reason |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `microsoft/markitdown` CLI/lib | **NEW** | `skills/markitdown` | Thin first-party skill: convert Office/PDF/HTML/CSV/XLSX/PPTX/EPUB/ZIP to Markdown, then hand off. |
| `markitdown-mcp` official | **FOREIGN_ON_DEMAND** | `mcp.markitdown` | Optional local stdio (`uvx --from markitdown-mcp==0.1.8 markitdown-mcp`). Local trusted agents only. |
| `opencode-markitdown` npm plugin | **REJECT** | `-` | Config-hook mutation forbidden. |
| community `trsdn-markitdown-mcp` | **REJECT** | `-` | Not Microsoft. |
| Azure Document Intelligence / Content Understanding | **DEFER** | `-` | No keys in config. |
| youtube / audio extras | **DEFER** | `-` | Out of document lane. |
| Duplicate SmartDoc modes | **REJECT** | `-` | SmartDoc keeps contract/QA/render. |

## Wave Anti-Slop (miqdad)

Selective merge of net-new anti-slop patterns (`miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop` v3.2.7+) into existing OCBF surfaces. Filter, not a second style system.

| Candidate | Decision | BestFriend Target | Reason |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 6 skills (`antislop`, `antislop-ui`, `copywriting`, `human`, `layoutmobile`, `code`) | **REJECT** | `-` | No catalog twins; filter folded into existing specialists. |
