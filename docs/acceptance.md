# Acceptance

`verify` = are installed owned files canonical?
`doctor` = is installation/config healthy?
`doctor --deep` = is live runtime proven?
`doctor --strict` = treat DEGRADED/WARN as failure.

A successful 1.8.0 install should report approximately:

```text

```

Deep acceptance additionally requires:

```text
PASS mcp:codebase-memory-mcp CONNECTED
PASS mcp:context7 CONNECTED
PASS mcp:shadcn CONNECTED
```

CBM current project not indexed is `DEGRADED CBM project CURRENT_REPO_NOT_INDEXED`, never a fake PASS.
Chromium stopped or port occupied is `DEGRADED`, not core FAIL unless `--strict`.

Public CI uses a tiny Design Bank fixture and a mock Codebase Memory binary. Live archive download is a manual acceptance test.
